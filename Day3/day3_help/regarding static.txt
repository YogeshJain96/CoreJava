static --- keyword in java
Usages
1. static data members --- Mem allocated only once @ class loading time --- not saved on object heap --- but in special mem area -- meta space . -- shared across all objects of the same class.
Initialized to their default values(eg -- boolean -false,ref -null)
How to refer ? -- className.memberName

eg -- public static int idCounter;

2. static methods --- Can be accessed w/o instantiation. (ClassName.methodName(....)) 
Can't access 'this' or 'super' from within static method.

Rules -- 1. Can static methods access other static members directly(w/o inst) -- YES
2. Can static methods access other non-static members directly(w/o inst) -- NO
3. Can non-static methods access other static members directly(w/o inst) -- YES
eg : In Test class
void test1() {test2();}
static void test2(){
 Test ref=new Test();
 ref.test1();
}


3. static import --- Can directly use all static members from the specified class.
eg --
import static java.lang.System.*;
main(...)
{
   out.println(.....);
}


4. static initializer blocks
syntax --
static {
// block gets called only once @ class loading time
// usage -- to init all static data members 
//& can add functionality -which HAS to be called precisely once.
Use case : singleton pattern
Design pattern (Creational) ---Ensuring SINGLE instance of the class throughoput the application.
Use case --- cache,device drivers, Loggers

 , J2EE for loading hibernate frmwork.
}

They appear -- within class definition & can access only static members directly.(w/o inst)
A class can have multiple static init blocks(legal BUT not reco.)


Regarding non-static initilizer blocks(inst initilaizer block)
syntax
{
//will be called per instantiation --- before matching constructor
//Better alternative --- parameterized constructor.
}

5. static nested classes ---
eg --
class Outer {
// static & non-static members
  static class Nested
  {
     //can access ONLY static members of the outer class DIRECTLY(w/o inst)
  }
}
