Upcasting

The most important aspect of inheritance is  the relationship expressed between the new class and the base class. This relationship can be summarized by saying, 
The new class "IS A" type of the existing class.
eg : Student is of Person type or Faculty is of Person type

This description is not just a fancy way of explaining inheritance—it’s supported directly by the language. 

Meaning :
Can we say ?
Person p=new Student(....);
p=new Faculty(...);
Object o=p;
Object o="abcd";


As an example, consider a base class called Instrument that represents musical instruments, and a derived class called Guitar. Because inheritance means that all of the methods in the base class are also available in the derived class, any message you can send to the base class can also be sent to the derived class. If the Instrument class has a play( ) method, so will Guitar. This means we can accurately say that a Guitar object is also a type of Instrument.
