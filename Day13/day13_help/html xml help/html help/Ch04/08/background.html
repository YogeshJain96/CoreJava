   <p>
   This example uses the background-image, 
   background-position and background-attachment
   styles to place the <span class = "dark">Deitel 
   & Associates, Inc.</span> logo in the bottom, 
   right corner of the page. Notice how the logo 
   stays in the proper position when you resize the 
   browser window.
