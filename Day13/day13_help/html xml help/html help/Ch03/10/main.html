   <h1>Welcome to Our Web Site!</h1>

   <p>We have designed this site to teach about the wonders of 
   <em>HTML</em>. We have been using <em>HTML</em> since version 
   <strong>2.0</strong>, and we enjoy the features that have been 
   added recently. It seems only a short time ago that we read 
   our first <em>HTML</em> book. Soon you will know about many of 
   the great new features of HTML 4.01.</p>

   <p>Have Fun With the Site!</p>
