New Scenario
Day 11
1. Create java application for customer management .

1.1 Customer class 
data members -- email(unique),password , reg amount,regDate(Date), type (enum : SILVER/GOLD/PLATINUM)
address(home address , office address,....)
Provide suitable constr to accept all details excluding address.
(Customer HAS-A Address)
How will you add multiple addresses?
Address -- city,state,country,phoneNo,type
Add a method linkAddress, to assign address to customer
eg : In Customer class ,
public void linkAddress(String city,String state,String country,String phoneNo,String type)

1.2 Currently no validation rules.
Can supply conversion methods in a separate class(string -->date , string--enum)

1.3 Create a Tester for following options
Start with hardcoded customers stored in suitable D.S (later restore it from bin file)
1. Register new customer
I/P --customer details
2. Link Address(Try last!)
customer email , password , adr details
3. Customer Login
customer email , password ,
4. Un subscribe customer
customer email , password ,
5. Display all customers of a particular type
I/P -- type (silver/gold/platinum)
6. Update Address(Try last!)

7. Sort customers as per email
8. Sort customers as per reg date.

2. Revise data read from text file.

3. Try this
Read data from std input (console i/p) & display it ,  till user says exit.


Day 12
Continue with day11 assignment & add persistence , using Object streams.
(When application starts , restore customer info from bin file. Before terminating , store customer info into a bin file)

Create separate class IOUtils , to add static methods for the same.
